# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development

Write out doctests and unittests for different python modules.

The test files are under the directory `tests` and can be run as:

```bash
# The tail command piped to sanitizes the output to give the general outcome
python3 -m doctest -v ./tests/test_file.txt | tail -2 # for doctests
```
